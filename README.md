## Setup
> Always make backups of your game files.
1. Locate The Rogue Glitch Game Files
   - Go to Steam Library 
   - Right click Rogue Glitch
   - Go to Properties 
   - \> Local Files 
   - \> Browse
2. Copy Files Over
   - Copy `RogueGlitch_Data` and `RogueGlitch.exe` into `game`
   - Copy `SaveData.glitch` into `profiles/Normal`
3. Make new profiles
   - Make a new folder in the profiles folder to make a new profile
     - Add a modified `Assembly-CSharp.dll` to the new folder if you want to modified gameplay, 
       - For example, with [RogueTron](https://github.com/gignaWedi/RogueTron), copy the .dll file from the `Modded` folder to the folder of your new profile and you are set.

Now just run the executable and you should be good to go.
